Highlights: 
- Novel Spectral Indices: Introduces the Soil pH Index (SPI) and Soil Organic Carbon Index (SOCI) specifically designed for hyperspectral data using PCA and ANN, addressing multicollinearity and dimensionality issues.
- Comparison of Input Features: Demonstrates that hyperspectral bands outperform existing spectral indices in predicting soil pH and SOC, achieving high predictive accuracy.
- Results of Proposed Indices: The SPI and SOCI indices achieve RÂ² values of 0.86 for AfSIS soil pH, 0.945 for LUCAS-2009 soil pH, 0.952 for AfSIS SOC, and 0.963 for LUCAS-2009 SOC.
